<h1>Frequently asked questions about the API</h1>

<h2>Why are the web services being provided?</h2>

<p>
    Several of my own sites use various real time data feeds from various providers. Some of those sites expose that
    data. For example on uktra.in <a href="http://uktra.in/api/rtppm/">RTPPM</a> is a real-time graph of the current
    performance of each Train Operating Company in the UK. To produce that plot the data is exposed via the API.
    This site provides various data feeds of the data used on the
</p>

<h2>What is an API key?</h2>

<p>An API key is a unique string that is assigned to you by ourselves. You should include this key in each web service request.</p>

<h2>Why do I have to register?</h2>

<p>Registration gives you access to a developer (API) key that allows access to the data in realtime.
    The key is included within each API call and allows the request to be authenticated.</p>

<p>Being registered enables us to provide you with information on any changes to the datafeeds that might affect your app or website,</p>

<p>The registration process, along with the use of API keys, also allows us to protect the API from security risks such as denial of service attacks.</p>

<h2>The API is currently Beta, what does that mean?</h2>

<p>A Beta product or website allows users to view and provide comment on something still under development.
    For the API this means that although changes to the overall service are possible, at this stage this is not likely
    to include changes to the datafeeds themselves. The service is supported as fully operational.</p>

<h2>Can an API key be blocked?</h2>

<p>We may block API keys of users that violate the Fair Use Policy or terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>How can an API key be unblocked?</h2>

<p>API keys can only be unblocked manually. To arrange for this to be done it is necessary to contact us.</p>
